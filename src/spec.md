# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the current gold accent styling with an orange accent across the DishMatch UI while keeping the existing dark theme, typography, and layout unchanged.

**Planned changes:**
- Update theme/tokens and any accent color usages so components that currently render with a gold accent (e.g., star ratings, filter sheet borders/buttons, badges) render with an orange accent instead.
- Ensure star rating visuals (filled stars and half-star gradient fill) consistently use the same orange accent color across the app, while keeping unfilled stars subdued on the dark background.

**User-visible outcome:** The app’s primary accent elements (including star ratings and related UI highlights) appear in orange instead of gold, with no other UI/feature changes and all text remaining in English.
